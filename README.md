# CFD & FEA Pipe Flow Study – ANSYS Fluent & Mechanical

## Project Overview
Numerical investigation of fluid flow and structural response in a 180° curved pipe.

## Methodology
- CFD simulation in ANSYS Fluent
- Mesh convergence study
- Evaluation of velocity profiles, pressure losses, and wall shear stress
- Static structural analysis under surge pressure loading

## Results
- Identified pressure loss characteristics in curved pipe geometry
- Located stress concentrations caused by internal pressure loading
- Evaluated safety factors under worst-case loading scenarios

## Skills Demonstrated
- CFD modelling and validation
- Structural FEA
- Interpretation of complex simulation data

## Tools Used
- ANSYS Fluent
- ANSYS Mechanical
